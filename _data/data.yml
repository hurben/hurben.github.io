career-profile:
    title: Research Fellow at Mayo Clinic
    summary: |
      I am interested in understanding autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis) from large-scale omics datasets and clinical data; and designing applications from such data for unmet clinical needs. To reach my goal, I am utilizing network-based methodologies and developing new in silico tools. Currently, I am working on a project involving a comprehensive multi-omics analysis aiming to understand the differences between different RA subtypes (i.e., ACPA-positive, ACPA-negative) and to identify diagnostic biomarkers for ACPA-negative RA patients.
