career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      Hello! I am Benjamin Hur. PhD in bioinformatics. I am trained to prioritize genes by handling multiple heterogeneous data at once. Confident with mouse data (microarray, RNAseq, DNAseq) as well as and making online, offline anaylsis, pipeline tools for other researchers. Experienced with network propagation (Random Walk with Restart), basic machine learning.

education:
    - degree: Ph.D. in Bioinformatics
      university: Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea
      time: 2012 - 2019
      details: |
        Thesis: "Informatics systems for analyzing and comparing biological experiments using network-based gene prioritization"
        
        Advisor: Sun Kim

        Main research areas:
          - Gene Prioritization
          - Big data mining
          - Web tool development

    - degree: BS in Mechanical Engineering
      university: Hongik University, Seoul, Republic of Korea
      time: 2007 - 2012
      details: |
        .

experiences:
    - role: Integration of Venn diagram and Network analysis
      time: Since 2017
      company: Seoul National University, Lab of Adipocyte and Metabolism Research (PI: Prof. Jaebum Kim). 
      details: |
      A web-based analysis tool to prioritize genes by integrating Venn diagram and network propagation method. This project began to address the needs of a new tool. Currently in review.

    - role: Srebf1 KO mouse, Adipocyte study
      time: Since 2016
      company: Seoul National University, Lab of Adipocyte and Metabolism Research (PI: Prof. Jaebum Kim). 
      details: |
      A study to find the relationship between Srebf1 KO effect and the senescence of adipocyte cells. My task is to find candidate genes from a RNA-seq data that have multiple controls and treatments.


    - role: Kaiso KO mouse, Spermatogenesis study
      time: Since 2016
      company: Yonsei University, Biochemistry-Molecular Biology Lab (PI: Man-wook Hur)
      details: |
      A study of how the KAISO (ZBTB33) KO affect spermatogenesis in mice. My role is to hunt down the candidate genes by investigating the expression alterations and the epigenetic events using RNA-seq and MBD-seq data. Collaborating with Dong-In Koh. Currently in review.

    - role: Human breast cancer study using RNA-seq and Exome-seq
      time: Since 2014-2016
      company: Prof. Wonshik Han (Seoul National University Hospital).
